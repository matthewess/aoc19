# Advent Of Code 2019

All the solutions are written in Haskell.

## Execution
Solutions for one day for both parts exist in one file prefixed with `Dn` where n is that particular day.

`stack runhaskell <filename>.hs < <required data file for that day>`

e.g. To execute solutions for the sixth day just do.

`stack runhaskell src/D06UniversalOrbitMap.hs < data/D06UniversalOrbitMap.txt`
